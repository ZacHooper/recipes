GUJARATI VAGHARA MAKKAI Spicy Sweetcorn with Ginger & Green Chilli
Stir-fried sweetcorn with ginger, green chilli and turmeric. Simple quick and delicious, this stir-fry is a must to accompany every thali. Iâ€™ve used tinned sweetcorn for this recipe, which is readily available.
First make the chilli and ginger paste by placing all the ingredients into a blender, along with 3 tablespoons of the sweetcorn, and blitz to a coarse paste. Set aside.
Heat the oil in a large frying pan (skillet) over a medium heat.  Add the asafoetida and mustard seeds, and fry for a few seconds until they sputter.
Add the prepared chilli and ginger paste and fry for 1 minute, stirring well. Add the turmeric and stir, then add the remaining sweetcorn and fry for 2 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, season, and add the fresh coriander and crushed peanuts.  Cover and cook for 1 more minute. Finish with the lime juice and serve warm.
